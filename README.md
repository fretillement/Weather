This is a project in which we endeavour to perform some analysis 
of the weather.

I am particularly interested in how ambient weather is associated 
with changes in Lake Michigan's water shore temperature.  

We are not weather expects and understand the difficulty of 
forecasting, and that there is already great prediction.  However,
many of the statistical questions we have are nuanced, and we want
to test the answers ourselves.  This exercise builds statistical
knowledge, progamming skills, and satisfies our curiousity.
